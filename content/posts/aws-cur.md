I wrote a blog post for the Arcesium engineering blog outlining some work I did on AWS Cost and Usage Report data analysis with Athena.

You can read the whole thing on [Medium](https://medium.com/arcesium-engineering-blog/better-aws-cost-report-analysis-with-terraform-and-athena-an-infrastructure-as-code-approach-5f9a874c6254).
